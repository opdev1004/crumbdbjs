# 🥇 CrumbDB JS
Document DBMS in Javascript. CrumbDB is designed and built for solving a problem with data file size limits.

## 👨‍🏫 Notice

### 🎉 Releasing version 0.2.0
PLEASE USE THE LATEST VERSION.
- Added document db structured functions. So there are 2 classes. One is `CrumbFiles` which is similar as v0.1.0. Another one is `CrumbDB` which is document database structured design.
- Now store string data value instead of assigning the data value to document name and convert that to string. Requires migration.
